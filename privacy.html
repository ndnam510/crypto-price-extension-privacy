  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective date: August 21, 2025</p>

  <p>This extension ("Crypto Price Extension") does not collect, store, or share any personal information from users.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>No personally identifiable information, financial data, health data, or browsing history is collected.</p>
  <p>The extension only reads highlighted text (such as "BTC" or "ETH") on the active tab in order to fetch the corresponding cryptocurrency price from the public CoinGecko API. This process happens locally and no data is stored or transmitted to any third-party servers other than CoinGecko.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This extension uses the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/">CoinGecko API</a> to retrieve cryptocurrency prices.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>If there are any changes to this Privacy Policy, updates will be published on this page.</p>
